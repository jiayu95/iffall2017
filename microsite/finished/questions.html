				<h1>Common Questions</h1>
				<div class="question">
					<p>Who wrote the book of John?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>The Gospel of John is anonymous. Traditionally, Christians have identified the author as "the Disciple whom Jesus loved" mentioned in John 21:24, who is understood to be John son of Zebedee, one of Jesus' Twelve Apostles. These identifications, however, are rejected by many modern biblical scholars. Nevertheless, the author of the fourth Gospel is sometimes called John the Evangelist, often out of convenience since the definitive name of the author is still debated.</p>

				<div class="question">
					<p>Why did God give us four Gospels?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Here are some reasons why God gave four Gospels instead of just one:
						<ol>
						<li>To give a more complete picture of Christ. While the entire Bible is inspired by God, He used human authors with different backgrounds and personalities to accomplish His purposes through their writing. Each of the gospel authors had a distinct purpose behind his gospel and in carrying out those purposes, each emphasized different aspects of the person and ministry of Jesus Christ.</li>
						<li>To enable us to objectively verify the truthfulness of their accounts. The Bible, from earliest times, states that judgment in a court of law was not to be made against a person based on the testimony of a single eyewitness but that two or three as a minimum number were required (Deuteronomy 19:15). Even so, having different accounts of the person and earthly ministry of Jesus Christ enables us to assess the accuracy of the information we have concerning Him.</li>
						<li>To reward those who are diligent seekers. Much can be gained by an individual study of each of the Gospels. But still more can be gained by comparing and contrasting the different accounts of specific events of Jesus' ministry.</li>
						</ol>

			<div class="question">
				<p>Who was the disciple whom Jesus loved?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>The Gospel of John is the only Gospel which mentions “the disciple whom Jesus loved.” John 13:23 tells us, "One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to Him." John 19:26 declares, "When Jesus saw His mother there, and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, 'Dear woman, here is your son.'" John 21:7 says, “Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, ‘It is the Lord!’” This disciple is never specifically identified, but the identity of the disciple whom Jesus loved is clear. The disciple whom Jesus loved is John, the son of Zebedee and brother of James.</p>
