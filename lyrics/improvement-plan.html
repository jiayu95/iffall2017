			<h2>Improvement Plan</h2>
			<p>I talked with Nicole Seo and Sukari Stone. I didn't follow all of their suggestions, but here are the ones that I did follow:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Try different colours for the bubbles because they blend it too much with the background at certain parts.</li>
				<li>Increase the line height.</li>
				<li>Think about how much of the lyrics I want the viewer to see at first glance through the viewport. Try making the first verse end right above the bottom of the viewport.</li>
				<li>Align certain stanzas differently.</li>
			</ul>
