		<h1><em>Taro – alt-j</em></h1>
		<strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
		<br>Indochina: Capa jumps Jeep
		<br>Two feet creep up the road
		<br>To photo, to record, meat lumps and war
		<br>They advance as does his chance
		<br>Very yellow white flash
		<br>A violent wrench grips mass
		<br>Rips light, tears limbs like rags
		<br>Burst so high, finally Capa lands
		<br>Mine is a watery pit
		<br>Painless with immense distance
		<br>From medic, from colleague, friend, enemy, foe
		<br>Him five yards from his leg
		<br>From you, Taro
		<br>Do not spray into eyes
		<br>I have sprayed you into my eyes
		<br>
		<br><strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
		<br>3:10 pm: Capa pends death
		<br>Quivers, last rattles, last chokes
		<br>All colours and cares glaze to grey
		<br>Shriveled and stricken to dots
		<br>The left hand grasps what the body grasps not
		<br><em>Le photographe est mort</em>
		<br>3.1415, alive no longer my amour
		<br>Fated for home, May of ‘54
		<br>Doors open like arms, my love
		<br>Painless with a great closeness
		<br>To Capa, to Capa Capa dark after nothing
		<br>Reunited with his leg and with you, Taro
		<br>Taro
		<br>Do not spray into eyes
		<br>I have sprayed you into my eyes
		<br>
		<br>Hey Taro
