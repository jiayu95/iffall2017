			<h1>SOMETIMES</h1>
			<h2>MIAMI HORROR</h2>

			<p>With eyes wide shut we lay stagnant awake
			<br>Safe for now in this wonderous state
			<br>Lost at a crossroad that's missing a sign
			<br>How do we know if they made it alive
			<br>There's something lurking in the distance ahead
			<br>Fragments of light shine away from the dead
			<br>They fantasize fury, no time left to stop
			<br>Its darkness approaching now we're at a loss
			<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus]
			<br>Sometimes, when all that's lost remains
			<br>Drink from the fountain of youth and never age again
			<br>Sometimes we jump across to every cloud
			<br>Fly away get lost and never be found
			<br>[Repeat 2x]
			<br>
			<br>

			There's something lurking from the shadows within
			<br>Stealing the colour and life from my skin
			<br>They fantasize fury at no extra cost
			<br>Darkness approaches now we're at a loss
			<br>
			<br>
			[Chorus 2x]
			<br>
			<br>
			Never be found, never be found...
			<br>
			<br>[Repeat all 2x]
